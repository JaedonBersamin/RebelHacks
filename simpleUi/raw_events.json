        "description": "<p><span>ach week this Fall will focus on a different topic representing the most frequently mentioned reasons people struggle with religion in general or Christianity in particular. This coming week (Sept. 19th) can be summed up in the question, \"How could there be only one way to God?\"&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Our weekly topic schedule will pretty closely match the chapters of the book \"The Reason For God\" by Timothy Keller. It was written by a pastor who spent years interviewing people about their greatest difficulies with Christianit</span>y and wanted to accurately summarize these concerns while offering an intelligent response. The first chapter deals with this week's question and is highly recommended for those participating as it summarizes the issues involved. You can find it here.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Reason-God-Belief-Skepticism/dp/0525950494\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Reason-God-Belief-Skepticism/dp/0525950494</a></p>\r\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\"><br />For those who prefer to listen over reading, the author also gave a series of messages on the same topics here:<br /><a href=\"http://sermons.redeemer.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&amp;category_id=29\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://sermons.redeemer.com/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&amp;category_id=29</a><br /><br />If you want to know where I'm coming from, I've also spoken on most of these Fall's upcoming topics and posted them here:<br /><a href=\"http://www.cwrsouthvalley.com/series-reasonforgod.html\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cwrsouthvalley.com/series-</a></div>",
